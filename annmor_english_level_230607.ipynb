       "\" enjoy the flick ben on phone michelle please don't hang up just talk to me okay i can't believe you just left michelle come back please say something michelle talk to me look we had an argument couples fight that is no reason to just leave everything behind running away isn't gonna help it any michelle please newscaster more details on that elsewhere today power has still not been restored to many cities on the southern seaboard in the wake of this afternoon's widespread blackout while there had been some inclement weather in the region the problem seems linked to what authorities are calling a catastrophic power surge that has crippled traffic in the area no no damn okay okay please please please don't hurt me please just let me go okay i won't tell anybody i promise okay please just let me go please man you need fluids you were in shock what are you going to do to me i'm going to keep you alive work on getting handy with these my boyfriend was expecting me he'll send the cops looking i'm sorry but no one is looking for you you've got some fight in you i can respect that but don't even think about trying that again you're lucky to be here at all and my generosity only extends so far eggs toradol to help with your pain please please just let me go please there is nowhere to go michelle i looked through your wallet given as how i saved your life i think that's acceptable you're lucky to be here at all what do you mean i found you and i saved your life by bringing you here i don't understand i there's been an attack what an attack a big one i'm not sure yet if it's chemical or nuclear but down here we're safe and where are we exactly underneath my farmhouse forty miles outside of lake charles i was driving north of here you were in an accident you were turned over on the side of the road i was driving by and i saw i saved your life michelle i couldn't just leave you there okay well thank you so much for saving my life i guess i should go to a hospital now you can't leave an attack means fallout which contaminates the air above ground that's how it works how long do we have to wait until it's safe depends on the proximity of the closest blast one year maybe two and that's if we're talking about weapons that we know of russians are developing some nasty stuff and if the martians finally figured out a way to get here their weapons will make the russkies' look like sticks and stones luckily i've prepared for this right well i'll need to use your phone then to call my family and tell them that i'm safe here and make sure they're okay michelle they're not okay how do you know that everyone outside of here is dead but what about you don't you have a family who's that excuse me howard what did you do you know what michelle i'm gonna tell you what i told him you need to eat you need to sleep and you need to start showing me a little bit of appreciation my name is howard by the way oh god oh shit i'm sorry i'm sorry about that uh i didn't mean to scare you are you um here you hungry so how are you doing you okay what is this it's a bunker your room's a little bit of a fixer upper but at least you got a door a scary door but you still got a door how long have you been down here couple of days i think you know it's actually kind of hard to tell with no windows or sunlight or anything i mean how do we get out of here oh he didn't tell you about getting out of here is the last thing you want to do because the air up there it's contaminated howard i see you've met emmett what happened to him he did that to himself and his stumbling around isn't helping anything what you heard earlier was him knocking over a shelf with a whole week's worth of food which he's sorry for correct totally let's go bathroom time howard this is the common area good for r r as you can see i've planned for a long stay the aquaponics system cleans the air and keeps it fresh this is the living room help yourself to any reading if you like to watch films i have some on dvd and vhs cassette just make sure you put them back in their sleeve when they're done the kitchen's fully functional has an electric stove refrigerator freezer silverware and that table's a family heirloom which means watch your glasses always use coasters and placemats keep your hands to yourself understand no touching take a seat this way this is my private space off limits unless i give express permission go ahead i don't need to you will though and i've got to pace these things out so please i need privacy you're welcome to close the curtain i can't with you standing there and i can't trust you not to burn this place down this is for my own safety i'm not some pervert just go howard don't flush unless you've gone we can't afford wasted flushes take a seat are you hungry those are megan's she never went anywhere without two or three of those things who's megan megan's not with us anymore don't worry just the generator maybe it's a car outside that's not possible i heard one earlier above my room if you had heard a car the driver would be long dead by now well shouldn't we at least try to call the police or someone to find out what actually happened there's no one left to call see that nothing's coming through you think i sound crazy i mean it's amazing you people you wear helmets when you ride your bikes you have seat belts in your cars you have alarm systems to protect your homes but what do you do when those alarms go off crazy is building your ark after the flood has already come i think maybe it's time you met frank and mildred closest i could get to an airlock see what happened to them they weren't as lucky as you it's the air michelle that's what happens when you get exposed i keep this door sealed at all times no one comes in or out emmett met frank and mildred huh it's funny right the whole world ends and the thing he's most upset about is a pair of dead pigs you in need of some reading material i took all the quizzes sorry but i did learn how to do a french braid so you know if you want me to do that for you just let me know what do you know about him he was in the navy i know that i guess he did uh some stuff with satellites what kind of stuff satellite stuff well what brought him out here i'm not sure he bought this property a while back but i never paid much attention till he hired me to help him get this place set up the work was entertaining though that's for sure you know howard's like a black belt in conspiracy theory plus you know how often do you get hired to help build a doomsday bunker so he didn't kidnap you no what about your arm weren't you trying to escape i was trying to get in i watched howard build this place piece by piece for years he was always talking about you know possible attacks from al qaeda russia south korea you mean north korea is that the crazy one so yeah that one and uh you know poured all his money into this place took to it like his life depended on it which you know that stays with you so he told you all this while you're building his bomb shelter and now he says that the air is contaminated and everybody's dead yeah i know what you're getting at but there's more to it howard abducted me he drove me off the road and he dragged me here so whatever he's telling you about the air some big attack the purpose of this shelter is a lie no no way the attack i saw it myself what do you mean i was on my way home from work and it looked like a flash bright red like an explosion from way far off it wasn't like fireworks naw this was more like something you'd read about in the bible so what you saw what a flash of light lightning a fire that flared up i'm not explaining it right this wasn't like anything i'd ever seen and so my first thought was to come here and when i got here howard was closing the door and i could see it right there on his face he knew something was happening something bad and so i fought my way in i heard a car right here above us you heard someone right above us that isn't possible the air is what contaminated how do you know that because i told him dinner's ready i see you two are getting along hmm how's that sauce it's fine as cooks go i'm okay not great but okay megan was a good cook you'll learn to love cooking mmm emmett mmm it's delicious that's the best sauce i've ever tasted are you being funny no i mean considering the alternative which is you know getting burnt up in a chemical attack or nuclear i'd say being alive and down here would make a fried turd taste pretty good so best damn sauce i ever had that's not a bad point and please watch your language at table right you know what i haven't been able to get out of my head for some reason ever since i got down here tattoos always wanted one but i never got any 'cause everybody always said no no emmett you'll never get a decent job if you do that whatever like that matters now right t ell you what if i had known this was coming i would've gotten like of them i swear man i would look like a circus freak or something i'd just be covered head to toe tattoos all over my you know everywhere face sure right there across my forehead just my name emmett or you know thug life yolo i don't even know what that means but you know i hear people saying it all the time so it must be cool hey what about you howard anything you wish you'd done in all honesty no no no crazy nights in vegas maybe uh take a pilgrimage to waco everything i wanted to do i did i focused on being prepared and i was and here we are emmett oh my goodness is that monopoly there we go yeah that's how we kill the time what would you say howard we're gonna be down here what like a year two maybe i bet you if we started a game right now we might even get halfway finished by the time stop talking you don't need to make jokes about how long we're going to be down here when nobody knows how long that's going to be your humor is not funny i don't appreciate it while i'm trying to eat and neither does michelle now please shut up and let us eat in peace hmm emmett would you pass me a napkin thank you i know what you're saying i never could finish monopoly that game really does take forever right for me though it was um chutes and ladders uh sorry and trouble you know the thing with the dice and the thing that you pressed what was that called the both pop o matic bubble yeah did you ever play that um what was that operation loved operation i'm telling you man i couldn't play that game it terrified me why that noise that thing would make when you hit that edge i mean good lord it was pretty scary could you hand me the salt please ah shoot i'm sorry i'm gonna need the pepper also what exactly do you think you're doing i'm asking for pepper like hell you were what was that i don't know what you're talking about howard are you trying to insult me here in the shelter that i built that's keeping you alive you don't think i see what you just did is that how you thank me for saving your life howard calm down shut up shut up and stay in your seat is it now let me tell you i know what a traitor looks like understand i have shown you nothing but generosity and hospitality i want you to apologize to tell me you're going to behave i will you will what i'll behave and i'm so sorry howard sit ah have to stay hydrated hmm that's easy to forget down here what's wrong nothing where are my keys michelle michelle stop give me those keys michelle come on howard no don't stop no no don't don't don't open that door there's a car there's a car i see a car howard no here here here howard michelle listen to me don't do this oh god thank god there's a woman woman open the door it's okay i just want to come inside she looks hurt she wants me to let her in do not let her in look at her face michelle no no no no no oh my god i'm fine i really am fine no please i'm okay there's it really only it only touched me a little a little so could you open the door open it she's begging me you can't help her no one can let me in i'll be okay i'll be okay it really hardly touched me at all open the door howard don't listen to her god open the door you bitch let me in let me in let me in let me in let me in you you you you you i know it's hard realizing they're all gone the ones you love i have something to confess to you i crashed into your car your accident was my fault when i found out about the incoming attack i got frantic i knew i needed to get back here as soon as possible so i was driving like a maniac i tried to pass you and i'm the reason you went off the road i mean i know i seem like a sensible guy but at the time i wasn't myself it was an accident but it was my fault i was afraid to tell you and i'm sorry um you should shower even the smallest amount of air that came through the hinges could be toxic these were megan's if you want i recognized that woman's car her name was leslie i think you knew her she was a neighbor emmett wasn't the only one who knew about this place if any others somehow survived they could be coming here too as of friday kindness and generosity are antiquated customs i'm going to need some stitches what you want me to this is your doing isn't it i mean i don't think i'm really qualified i'll walk you through it here have a drink what is it technically it's vodka ah it's safe i distilled it myself i just said i distilled it i didn't say anything about it actually tasting good yeah that's awful you want it on the rocks little trick i taught myself as a young man stationed on a ship with way too much free time every now and again if the c o was working us too hard we'd freeze and snap the knob off the bathroom door while he was still inside it usually took him an hour or two to get out i'm good suit yourself cheers ah this is clean all you need to do is stitch you're doing fine howard some stuff i grabbed from your car i didn't have time to bring in the booze sadly what is all that i wanted to design clothes no wonder you were so good with the stitches megan wanted to be an artist she was your daughter yes she was smart loved to read the magazines were just for fun she inhaled books anything with paris she liked their movies their culture you know we used to have this little joke every once in a while i'd ask her what do you want to be when you grow up you know what she'd say french anyway her mother turned her against me took her off to chicago people are strange creatures you can't always convince them that safety is in their own best interest you don't know they're gone anyway at least i tried to help them emmett hey there was nothing you could've done for that woman even if you let her in she still would've died you asked earlier about regrets yeah i've got some of those welcome to the club i mean i lived my life in a mile radius and that was by design i made sure that happened i was so fast in high school i even managed to outrun my bad grades i was all state track three years in a row caught a full ride to louisiana tech up there in ruston i remember i spent the last two weeks of that summer showing off the bus ticket they sent me to anybody who'd take a look at it and then came the night before i was supposed to leave and i just got so worried about how bad i was gonna do up there with all those smart kids so i went out of my way to get just piss wasted so bad that i knew there was no chance i was waking up in the morning so i missed the bus and i didn't buy a ticket for the next one or the one after that well if you'd gone you might be dead now yeah lucky me right lucky us a few years ago i was at a hardware store and there was this little girl with her dad and he was in a hurry and she wasn't keeping up so he kept yanking on her arm but really hard you know too hard i know that feeling when my dad got that way my brother colin was always there to take the worst of it for me and i thought seeing this little girl i thought maybe i could do that for her but i just kept watching and they're about to leave and i've done nothing and she slips and it throws him off balance and he hits her and i wanted so badly to do something to help her but i did what i always do when things get hard i just panicked and ran look we're here we're alive and that means something it's gotta you've got to be kidding me what we're missing pieces here look at this poor cat he's been deformed he's got one eye he's about to go snorkeling and everything too what are you doing ooh cornering the market on post apocalyptic fashion huh mmm hmm you need more axes and chain saws for what she has a shotgun yeah but what if up there it's like what lumberjacks zombies though even howard doesn't think that one's plausible but you should hear his theory about mutant space worms what is that howard stay calm we're okay what was that quiet that sounds like helicopters howard could be military but not ours emmett how can you tell fourteen years in the navy what's happening up there my guess those flashes that kicked this all off that was phase one take out your opponent's population centers with big hits all at once fast and then for round two ground sweeps a satellite log showed an increase in coded traffic recently possibly extraterrestrial signals i bet what we just heard were airborne patrols sent to hunt down the remaining signs of life like us okay oh boy that's bad and that's worse what's up there air filtration system i can't something blocking the hatch if we can't get it back on we're gonna run out of breathable air fast you're the only one small enough to reach it reach what the filtration system through there the main duct someone needs to get in there and restart it give me a hand let me go she's not gonna know her way around the unit you won't fit plus your arm she'll be fine now to restart the unit you just swing the handle off then on off then on that should do it and neither of us will be able to go in and help you if you get stuck don't get stuck howard michelle everything okay up there it looks like a dead end howard that's the incline climb up that and you're almost there ah this sucks emmett what's wrong howard he lied he lied about megan what do you mean i think he did something horrible to her no his family moved to chicago years ago what's this is that blood here come with me wait that that's not megan what do you mean yeah her name is brittany i remember her she went to high school with my little sister she she went missing two years back it was on the news and everything most people just thought she skipped town there was a message up there it said help it was scratched on the inside of the window and this earring this earring was with it did she ever show back up after she went missing he said to me he said to my face that this was his daughter he said this was megan he took her and he killed her all right let's just think maybe we take away his gun tie him up get him to confess to whatever it is he's done confess to who the police look like i said we can't be the only survivors right the woman she was able to get around right at least a little yeah until she died directly above us making choking noises of all the people to save us howard now that was a great example of teamwork very well done i feel like some music problem solving always puts me in a musical mood michelle you should go shower just in case sure i think i might have an idea ten better ways to style my bangs no not the article this i think i can only make one but it's a start no kidding what are you doing up i didn't wake you up yet man well i'm fixing your breakfast one egg over medium hey howard what is this you re watching sixteen candles pretty in pink it was one of megan's favorite movies can i help you with something no no i'm just grabbing some water say um you know i was just thinking not that i'm trying to tell you how to run this place or anything i'm just a little curious michelle say how close do you think she got to that air filtration unit you think she touched it yeah i'm pretty sure she touched it well i know she cleaned up after and everything but i'm just thinking given that unit filters god knows what through from outside if she tracked anything back in with her it'd be pretty concentrated and i mean it could be all over the shower and the sink in your bathroom right now anyway it's just a thought emmett not bad so far partner michelle if howard finds this he's gonna kill us all right so we get the gun away from him all right we tie him up make sure he isn't going anywhere and then one of us just goes out and looks for help um first word uh tiny small pygmy um little yep mmm hmm all right uh second word ooh michelle is a a girl a girl a child um a girl no she's older see so she is a little princess um no it was woman um little women wow little woman next time try being a little more specific let's see here i'm always watching always um god i go wherever i want uh i mean well i don't know i know what you're doing i see what you're doing um i know what you're up to look howard i don't know what you're getting at but i see you when you're sleeping i know what you're doing and i'm always watching always watching i'm always watching santa claus you're santa
